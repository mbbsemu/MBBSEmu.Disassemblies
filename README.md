# MBBSEmu.Disassemblies
A collection of IDA &amp; ASM Disassemblies for The MajorBBS &amp; Worldgroup Modules
 
## What are these files and how do I use them?
Part of working on any emulator is reverse engineering the applications that will be running within your emulator to not only better understand how they work, but also how to make your emulator work better for them! This repository is a collection of disassembled MajorBBS & Worldgroup modules in several formats to help anyone who would want to collaborate on [The MajorBBS Emulation Project](https://www.mbbsemu.com) better understand the inner workings of the modules they're running in the emulator.

#### What is a .i64 File?
The provided .i64 files are IDA Database files that contain the disassembly of the provided module. They can be opened and worked on using [IDA Freeware](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware/)

#### What is a .ASM File?
This is an export from IDA into a text file containing the raw x86 Assembler. This file cannot be directly assembled/linked, but is provided for those who don't want to work in IDA or have other development tools for x86 Assembler they'd like to use.
